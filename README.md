# `pd3f` â€“ PDF Text Extractor

> Beyond PDF

*Experimental, use with care.*

`pd3f` is a PDF **text extraction** pipeline that is self-hosted, local-first and Docker-based.
It **reconstructs** the original **continuous text** with the help of **machine learning**.

`pd3f` can OCR scanned PDFs with [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF) (Tesseract) and extracts tables with [Camelot](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot) and [Tabula](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula).
It's built upon the output of [Parsr](https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr).
Parsr detects hierarchies of text and splits the text into words, lines and paragraphs.

Even though Parsr brings some structure to the PDF, the text is still scrambled, i.e., due to hyphens.
The underlying Python package [`pd3f-core`](https://github.com/pd3f/pd3f-core) tries to reconstruct the original continuous text by removing hyphens, new lines and / or spaces.
It uses [language models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-language-modeling-and-neural-language-models/) to guess how the original text looked like.

`pd3f` is especially useful for languages with long words such as German.
It was mainly developed to parse German letters and official documents.
Besides German `pd3f` supports English, Spanish and French.
More languages will be added a later stage.

`pd3f` includes a Web-based GUI and a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)-based microservice (API).
You can find a demo at [demo.pd3f.com](https://demo.pd3f.com).

A more systematic evaluation of `pd3f` will follow in September 2020.

## Installation

You need to setup [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You need the `docker-compose.yml` file of this repository. You can download it separately or just fetch the whole repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pd3f/pd3f
```

Then go to the folder of this repository and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The first time the `pd3f` starts it will download the Docker images.
You need to have ~8 GB of space to store all the software / data to run this.


## Using the GUI

The first time you upload a PDF, `pd3f` will download some large languages models.
After it's finished access the Web-based GUI at <http://localhost:1616>.

After uploading a PDF you will get redirected to a web page displaying progress / results of the job.

## Using the API

```python
import time

import requests

files = {'pdf': ('test.pdf', open('/dir/test.pdf', 'rb'))}
response = requests.post('http://localhost:1616', files=files, data={'lang': 'de'})
id = response.json()['id']

while True:
    r = requests.get(f"http://localhost:1616/update/{id}")
    j = r.json()
    if 'text' in j:
        break
    print('waiting...')
    time.sleep(1)
print(j['text'])
```

Post params:
 - `lang`: set the language (options: 'de', 'en', 'es', 'fr')
 - `fast`: whether to check for tables (default: False)
 - `tables`: whether to check for tables (default: False)
 - `experimental`: whether to extract text in experimental mode (footnotes to endnotes, depuplicate page header / footer) (default: False)
 - `check_ocr`: whether to check first if all pages were OCRd (default: True, cannot be modified in GUI)

You have to poll for `/update/<uuid>` to keep up with the progress. The responding JSON tells you about the status of the processing job.

Fields:
 - `log`: always present, text output from the job.
 - `text` and `tables` and `filename`: only present when the job finished successfully
 - `position`: present if on waiting list, returns position as integer
 - `running`: present if job is running
 - `failed`: present if job has failed

### Scaling

You can also run more worker with this:

```bash
docker-compose up --scale worker=3
```

To increase the frontend threads, change this line in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
command: gunicorn app:app --workers=5 --bind=0.0.0.0:5000
```

You may as well create a new `docker-compose.yml` to override certain settings. Take a look at [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](./docker-compose.prod.yml)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --scale worker=2
```

### House Keeping

You will see three folders:

- `pd3f-data-uploads`: input & output files
- `pd3f-data-cache`: storing data so you don't have to download model files over and over again
- `pd3f-data-to-ocr`: temporary location for PDFs to get OCRd. Files get deleted but logs get kept.

Results are kept for 24 hours per default. But no files get deleted automatically (only the results in the queue (e.g. the extracted text)).

Run this command from time to time to schedule jobs in order to delete files in `pd3f-data-uploads` and `pd3f-data-to-ocr`.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm worker rqscheduler --host redis --burst
```

## FAQ

### Parsr can also do OCR, why do use OCRmyPDF?

OCRmyPDF uses various image preprocessing to improve the image quality.
This improves the output of Tesseract.
Parsr uses raw Tesseract so the results are worse.

### Parsr can also extract text, why is your tool needed?

The text output of Parsr is scrambled, i.e. hyphens are not removed.
`pd3f` improves the overall text quality by reconstructing the original text with language models.
See [pd3f-core](https://github.com/pd3f/pd3f-core) for details.

Overall Parsr is a great tool, but it still has rough edges.
`pd3f` improves the output with various (opinionated) hand-crafted rules.
`pd3f` mainly focuses on formal letters and official documents for now.
Based on this assumption we can simplify certain things.
It was developed mainly for German documents but it should work for other languages as well.

## Running `pd3f` in Production with Nginx

An example config for Nginx to run in conjunction with [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](./docker-compose.prod.yml):

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=limitfiles:10m rate=1r/s;
proxy_cache_path /var/nginx/cache keys_zone=pd3fcache:1m inactive=1m max_size=10M;

server {
    server_name demo.pd3f.com;
    client_max_body_size 50M;

    if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|HEAD|POST)$ )
    {
        return 405;
    }

    # prevent guessing of file names
    location /files/ {
        limit_req zone=limitfiles burst=2 nodelay;
        alias /var/pd3f/pd3f-data-uploads/;
        add_header Content-disposition "attachment";
    }

    location /update/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1616;
    }

    # simple caching
    location / {
        proxy_cache pd3fcache;
        expires 10m;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1616;
    }

    # restrict access to a IP / Subnet + protect with Basic Auth
    location /dashboard/ {
        allow xx.xx.xx.xx;
        deny all;

        auth_basic "Private Area";
        auth_basic_user_file /path/to/.htpasswd;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9181;
}
```

Make sure set to set the correct permission to let Nginx serve the static files (in `/var/pd3f/pd3f-data-uploads/`).


## Future Work / TODO

PDFs are hard to process and it's hard to extract information.
So the results of this tool may not satisfy you.
There will be more work to improve this software but altogether, it's unlikely that it will successfully extract all the information anytime soon.

Here some things that will get improved.

### statics about how long processing (per page) took in the past

- calculate runtime based on `job.started_at` and `job.ended_at`
- Get average runtime of jobs and store data in redis list

### more information about PDF

- NER
- entity linking
- extract keywords
- use [textacy](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy)

### add more language

- check if flair has model
- what to do if there is no fast model?


### Python client

- simple client based on request
- send whole folders

### Markdown / HTML export

- go beyond text

### use pdf-scripts / allow more processing

- reduce size
- repair PDF
- detect if scanned
- force to OCR again

### improve logs / get better feedback

- show uncertainty of ML model
- allow different log levels

## Related Work

I compiled a list of PDF processing tools in [my blog post](https://johannesfilter.com/python-and-pdf-a-review-of-existing-tools/).

## Development

Install and use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

Initially run:

```bash
./dev.sh --build
```

Omit `--build` if the Docker images do not need to get build.
Right now Docker + poetry is not able to cache the installs so building the image all the time is uncool.
